UTS Timetable Generator
=======================
Currently a Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script that generates valid timetables given a number of UTS subjects.

The final state will be a single-page AngularJS app - work is currently active in the [timetableUI](https://github.com/UnofficialUTS/uts-timetable-generator/tree/timetableUI) branch - check it out and offer some suggestions if you have any :)
